# To Do App

A django project which has the ability to create, retrieve, add and delete data into the system. This project was made to revise my CRUD with django concept again and all the basic concepts such as search, authentication, etc. I also worked a little on UI, so do appreciate.

## Tech Used
Django , Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, Javascript, Jquery.

## Key Features
* You can register and login in app.
* You can create your personalized to do list with ability to edit, change status from working to completed or vice versa as well as delete item.
* The UI was worked hard upon, so do check it out.
* If you don't want to create an account you can use , username :**amanjha** and password : **7**, to check the app out.
